        <p id="google">Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students 
            at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control
             56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as 
             a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then 
             reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002. 13  An initial public offering (IPO) took place on 
             August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the 
             Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a 
             conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the
              umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google,
               replacing Larry Page who became the CEO of Alphabet.</p></br>
             <p id="facebook">The founders initially limited Facebook membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded
                  to Columbia, Stanford, and Yale before being expanded to the rest of the Ivy League, MIT, and 
                  higher education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly 
                  high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed 
                  o become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws. The name 
                  comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.
                Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers,
                 tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information 
                 about themselves.</p></br>
             <p id="instagram">Instagram (sometimes abbreviated as IG[10]) is an American photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and launched in October 2010 on iOS. A version for Android devices was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited website interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app on June 15, 2014, and an app for Windows 10 tablets and computers in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media, which can be edited with filters and organized with tags and location information. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a feed.</p></br>
            <p id="twitter">Twitter (/ˈtwɪtər/) is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface, through Short Message Service (SMS) or its mobile-device application software ("app").[16] Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[17] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[18]</p></br>
             <p id="youtube">YouTube is an American online video-sharing platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. Three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—created the service in February 2005. Google bought the site in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion; YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries.
                YouTube allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to playlists, report, comment on videos, and subscribe to other users. It offers a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos. Available content includes video clips, TV show clips, music videos, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and other content such as video blogging, short original videos, and educational videos.</p></br>
            <p id="skype">Skype (/skaɪp/) is a telecommunications application that specializes in providing video chat and voice calls between computers, tablets, mobile devices, the Xbox One console, and smartwatches over the Internet.

                In March 2020, Skype was used by 100 million people on a monthly basis and by 40 million people on a daily basis.[9] That was a 70% increase in the number of daily users from the previous month, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></br>
            <p id="whatsapp">WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an American freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP (VoIP) service owned by Facebook, Inc.[45] It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,[46] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other media.[47][48] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers, as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app.[49] The service requires users to provide a standard cellular mobile number for registering with the service.[50] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client</p></br>
            <p id="snapchat">Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover," letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the "my eyes only" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space. It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.</p></br>
             <p id="wikipedia">Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, and was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[14] Sanger coined its name[15][16] as a portmanteau of the words "wiki" (Hawaiian for "quick")[17] and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.1 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 54 million articles[18] attracting 1.5 billion unique visitors per month.[19][20]
                In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,</p></br>
            <p id="linkedin">LinkedIn (/lɪŋktˈɪn/) is an American business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Launched on May 5, 2003,[5] it is mainly used for professional networking, including employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their CVs.

As of May 2020, LinkedIn had 690+ million registered members in 150 countries.</p></br>
          <p id="google2">Google+ (pronounced and sometimes written as Google Plus; sometimes called G+) was a social network owned and operated by Google. The network was launched on June 28, 2011, in an attempt to challenge other social networks, linking other Google products like Google Drive, Blogger and YouTube. The service, Google's fourth foray into social networking, experienced strong growth in its initial years, although usage statistics varied, depending on how the service was defined. Three Google executives oversaw the service, which underwent substantial changes that led to a redesign in November 2015.</p></br>
